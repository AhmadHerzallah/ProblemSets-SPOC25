# Problem Set 2

This file describes how to run/test PSET 2.

To run the problem set with the provided test cases, simply run:

```sh
# In the pset2/ folder
$ python pset2.py
# python.exe pset2.py on Windows
```

To test a particular function with a particular input, you can instead start a Python console (i.e., running `python` without any files) and then:
```py
>>> from pset2 import * # import all the functions in the pset2.py file
>>> solution_a(42, 0.2, 0.04)
31.38
```
