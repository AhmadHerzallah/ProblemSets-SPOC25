# PROBLEM SETS SELF-CRITIQUE SOLUTION-TESTING MODEL
Dear TAs,

Please find in this directory file `pset1.py`, which shows the model we will follow for the Problem Sets handed to our students. This technique would be efficient for students to learn the most from the curriculum provided through MITx, In which solution code would be written under the `solution()` method. In contrast, tests are being provided under the `main()` method, allowing students to write code and test it simultaneously, with the flexibility to manipulate the test cases, which is not required anyway.

Moreover, we will follow the model of filling in the blanks when writing lines of codes of methods needed inside the `solution()` method by writing comments/hints for students to follow to make solving the problem set more fun and efficient.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Head TAs, Ahmad and Baltasar.

Sincerely, <br/>
Your Head TAs.
